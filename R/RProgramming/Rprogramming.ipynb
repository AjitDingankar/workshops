    "\n",
    "This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with\n",
    "basic knowledge of R. It is intended for those already comfortable with\n",
    "using R for data analysis who wish to move on to writing their own\n",
    "functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisite: basic familiarity with R, such as acquired from an\n",
    "introductory R workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent possible this workshop uses real-world examples. That is\n",
    "to say that concepts are introduced as they are needed for a realistic\n",
    "analysis task. In the course of working through a realistic project we\n",
    "will lean about regular expressions, iteration, functions, control flow\n",
    "and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop uses the\n",

    "Everyone should have R installed -- if not:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Open a web browser and go to <http://cran.r-project.org> and\n",
    "    download and install it\n",
    "-   Also helpful to install RStudio (download from <http://rstudio.com>)\n",

    "Example project overview\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for data to be made available on a website somewhere,\n",
    "either by a government agency, research group, or other organizations\n",
    "and entities. Often the data you want is spread over many files, and\n",
    "retrieving it all one file at a time is tedious and time consuming. Such\n",
    "is the case with the baby names data we will be using today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk) provides\n",
    "yearly data on the most popular baby names going back to 1996. The data\n",
    "is provided separately for boys and girls. These data have been cleaned\n",
    "up and copied to\n",
    "<http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/example_data/baby_names/>. Although we\n",
    "could open a web browser and download files one at a time, it will be\n",
    "faster and easier to instruct R to do that for us. Doing it this way\n",
    "will also give us an excuse to talk about iteration, text processing,\n",
    "and other useful techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting information from a text file (string manipulation)\n",
    "=============================================================\n",

    "Our first goal is to download all the .csv files from\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to do that we need a list of the Uniform Resource Locators\n",
